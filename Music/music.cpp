/*
Classes are user-defined types.

Objects are instances of classes.

Class members are the data attributes and functions inside of a class.

Creating a new object from a class is called instantiation.

Class members can be designated as either private or public â€” they are private by default.

You can create a constructor to instantiate objects in a particular way.

A destructor allows you to execute any cleanup necessary before an object gets destroyed.
