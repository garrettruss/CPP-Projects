/* 
Null Pointer
When we declare a pointer variable like so, its content is not intialized:

int* ptr;
In other words, it contains an address of “somewhere”, which is of course not a valid location. This is dangerous! We need to initialize a pointer by assigning it a valid address.

But suppose we don’t know where we are pointing to, we can use a null pointer.

nullptr is a new keyword introduced in C++11. It provides a typesafe pointer value representing an empty pointer.

We can use nullptr like so:

int* ptr = nullptr;
Note: In older C/C++ code, NULL was used for this purpose. nullptr is meant as a modern replacement to NULL.

#include <iostream>

int main()
{

    int power = 9000;

    // Create pointer
    int *ptr = nullptr;

    // Later in the program...
    ptr = &power;

    // Print ptr
    std::cout << ptr << "\n";
